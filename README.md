# Lovial Engine

Lovial Engine is simply just some bindings for Jovial Engine enabling people to develop games without the need for a 
c++ compliant compiler.

The project is still in a very unfinished and unrealized state. I would not recommend trying to create a full game
in it as of yet. However, for recreational game development and education it is perfect. 

# Jovial Editor

Jovial Editor is a very simple text editor that tries to bring the most powerful aspects of other editors without the bloat.

# Support

Windows is always the first to get supported by me. 
Linux is often supported as well, however, it is only tested on debian 12 so expect bugs.

OSX is not yet supported but it is on the roadmap.
